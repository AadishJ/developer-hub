# Optimizing Log Queries in Parseable

Effective log analysis depends on your ability to write efficient queries. In this post, we'll explore techniques to optimize your Parseable log queries for better performance and insights.

## Understanding Parseable's Query Engine

Parseable uses a powerful SQL-based query engine built on Apache Arrow. This architecture provides several advantages:

- Column-oriented storage for faster analytical queries
- Vectorized query execution
- Predicate pushdown for efficient filtering
- Parallel query processing

## Query Optimization Techniques

### 1. Use Time-Based Filtering

Always include time constraints in your queries to limit the data scanned:

```sql
SELECT * FROM logs 
WHERE timestamp >= '2023-07-01T00:00:00Z' 
AND timestamp < '2023-07-02T00:00:00Z'
```

### 2. Select Only Needed Columns

Instead of using `SELECT *`, specify only the columns you need:

```sql
SELECT timestamp, level, message, service_name
FROM logs
WHERE level = 'error'
```

### 3. Leverage Indexed Fields

Parseable automatically indexes certain fields. Use these for faster filtering:

```sql
SELECT * FROM logs
WHERE service_name = 'api-gateway'
AND level = 'error'
```

### 4. Use Aggregations Wisely

Aggregations can help summarize large volumes of data:

```sql
SELECT 
  service_name,
  COUNT(*) as error_count
FROM logs
WHERE level = 'error'
GROUP BY service_name
ORDER BY error_count DESC
```

## Monitoring Query Performance

Parseable provides query execution statistics to help you understand and optimize performance:

- Query execution time
- Bytes scanned
- Rows processed

Use these metrics to identify and refine slow-performing queries.

## Conclusion

By following these optimization techniques, you can significantly improve the performance of your log queries in Parseable, enabling faster troubleshooting and more efficient log analysis.
