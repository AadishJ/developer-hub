# Introducing Parseable

Parseable is a modern, cloud-native logging solution designed to handle logs at scale. Built with performance and simplicity in mind, Parseable offers a powerful alternative to traditional logging systems.

## Why Parseable?

Traditional logging solutions often struggle with the volume and velocity of logs generated by modern applications. Parseable addresses these challenges by:

- **High Performance**: Built on Rust and Apache Arrow for blazing-fast log ingestion and querying
- **Cloud Native**: Designed to run seamlessly in Kubernetes and other cloud environments
- **Simple Setup**: Get started in minutes with minimal configuration
- **SQL Querying**: Query your logs using familiar SQL syntax
- **Schema Enforcement**: Ensure log quality with schema validation

## Getting Started

Getting started with Parseable is easy:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 parseablehq/parseable:latest
```

Once running, you can send logs to Parseable using simple HTTP requests:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/logstream/my-app \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"message": "Hello, Parseable!", "level": "info"}]'
```

## What's Next?

In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing more about Parseable's features, use cases, and best practices. Stay tuned for:

- Deep dives into Parseable's architecture
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration guides for popular frameworks
- Advanced querying techniques

We're excited to have you join us on this journey to better logging!
